# TESTING
# call the get method which passes the GET verb, path and handler to the route method. This will add a new route
# verb = GET, path = "/hello" between do/end is a block(become &handler Proc)
get "/hello" do
  "Hello World!!!!"
end

# test post method by running: curl --data "Hi there!!" localhost:9292/hello
post "/hello" do
  request.body.read

# this is the handler for Nancy::Base
# Rack handlers take a Rack app and actually run them.
